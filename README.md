# MarketPlace
## Backend appliciation for Product sell
Overview of the Marketplace Backend System
Your marketplace backend system allows users to perform various operations such as registering, logging in, managing their own products, viewing all products, placing orders, and managing their wallet balance. The system is built using Express.js as the backend framework, MongoDB as the database, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and follows the REST API architecture along with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

# API Endpoints
Here’s a summary of the key API endpoints in your system:
## User Service:
POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login: Log in an existing user.
## Product Service:
POST /api/products/create: Add a new product.
PUT /api/products/update: Update product details.
PATCH /api/products/remove: Delete a product.
GET /api/products: View all products.
GET /api/products/:id: View a specific product by ID.
## Order Service:
POST /api/orders/create: Create a new order.
GET /api/orders/:id: View details of a specific order.
GET /api/orders/:id/byUser: View all orders by the user.
## Wallet Service:
POST /api/wallet/credit: Credit money to the wallet.
GET /api/wallet/balance: View wallet balance.
POST /api/wallet/debit: Debit Money from the Wallet.
GET /api/wallet/transaction: All transactions by User..

# Security Considerations
JWT Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated users can access the APIs. The JWT token is passed in the Authorization header of each request.
Authorization: The system checks whether the user is authorised to perform certain actions, such as updating or deleting a product.
Password Security: User passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, ensuring they are not stored in plain text.
Conclusion
This marketplace backend system is a well-architected solution that allows users to interact with products, place orders, and manage their wallet in a secure and scalable manner. By using Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, and following RESTful principles and the MVC design pattern, you’ve created a system that is both flexible and robust.
