Overview of the Marketplace Backend System
Your marketplace backend system allows users to perform various operations such as registering, logging in, managing their own products, viewing all products, placing orders, and managing their wallet balance. The system is built using Express.js as the backend framework, MongoDB as the database, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, and follows the REST API architecture along with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
Key Components
Express.js:
Express.js is used to create the backend server. It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications, handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/responses.
MongoDB:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store the data for your system. It is schema-less, which makes it flexible for storing various types of data like users, products, orders, and wallet transactions.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
JWT is used for securing your APIs. It ensures that only authenticated users can access the resources. JWT tokens are issued upon successful login and are required for making subsequent API calls.
REST API Architecture:
The system follows the REST API architecture, where each resource (like users, products, orders, etc.) is represented by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are used to perform operations on these resources.
MVC Design Pattern:
The system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:
Model: Represents the data structure (e.g., User, Product, Order, Wallet models).
View: In the context of a backend, the view can be considered the response data sent to the client.
Controller: Contains the logic for handling incoming requests, interacting with the model, and returning the appropriate responses.
System Functionality
User Authentication & Authorization:
Users can register and log in to the system.
Registration: A user can create an account by providing their name, email, and password. The password is hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the MongoDB database.
Login: A user logs in by providing their email and password. If the credentials are correct, the system generates a JWT token and returns it to the user. This token is required for subsequent requests to ensure the user is authenticated.
Authorization: JWT tokens are used to verify that the user is authorised to perform certain actions. For example, only the owner of a product can update or delete it.
Product Management:
Add Product: Authenticated users can add new products to the marketplace. They must provide details like product name, description, price, stock, and category.
Update Product: Users can update the details of their own products (e.g., changing the price or stock).
Delete Product: Users can delete their own products from the marketplace.
View Products: All authenticated users can view the list of all available products in the marketplace. They can also view the details of a specific product by its ID.
Order Management:
Create Order: Users can place orders for products available in the marketplace. The system checks if the user has sufficient funds in their wallet before placing the order. If successful, the order is created, and the wallet balance is updated accordingly.
View Orders: Users can view their own orders and track their status (e.g., pending, shipped).
Wallet Management:
Credit Wallet: Users can add money to their wallet. This allows them to make purchases within the marketplace.
View Wallet Balance: Users can view the current balance of their wallet.
API Endpoints
Here’s a summary of the key API endpoints in your system:
User Service:
POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login: Log in an existing user.
Product Service:
POST /api/products/create: Add a new product.
PUT /api/products/update: Update product details.
PATCH /api/products/remove: Delete a product.
GET /api/products: View all products.
GET /api/products/:id: View a specific product by ID.
Order Service:
POST /api/orders/create: Create a new order.
GET /api/orders/:id: View details of a specific order.
GET /api/orders/:id/byUser: View all orders by the user.
Wallet Service:
POST /api/wallet/credit: Credit money to the wallet.
GET /api/wallet/balance: View wallet balance.
POST /api/wallet/debit: Debit Money from the Wallet.
GET /api/wallet/transaction: All transactions by User..
Security Considerations
JWT Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated users can access the APIs. The JWT token is passed in the Authorization header of each request.
Authorization: The system checks whether the user is authorised to perform certain actions, such as updating or deleting a product.
Password Security: User passwords are hashed before being stored in the database, ensuring they are not stored in plain text.
Conclusion
This marketplace backend system is a well-architected solution that allows users to interact with products, place orders, and manage their wallet in a secure and scalable manner. By using Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, and following RESTful principles and the MVC design pattern, you’ve created a system that is both flexible and robust.
